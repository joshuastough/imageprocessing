    "**Block viewing** is mportant for understanding ubiquitous image and video compression schemes like JPEG\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider an image as a grid of non-overlapping blocks, each block containing a number of pixels. A **block transform** is where we replace each block from the original image with a block of our choosing. We could choose to replace the whole collection of pixels in a block with the average or median color of the block. \n",
    "\n",
    "The compression schemes we will be soon learning about rely on spatial coherence to consider each block as a collection of characteristics (mean, differences, whatever) rather than as a collection if independent pixels. Depending on the descriptive power of any particular characteristic, we may choose to heavily quantize or even ignore that characteristic in order to save space, leading to a lossy compression that does not badly affect the perceived image quality."
