    "Put together an interactive demo that shows the original image, its current reconstruction, and a view of the currently quantized transform coefficients. This demo should then interact with a `FloatSlider` that affects the multiple applied to the Q quantization matrix. This demo would show how you could increase the compression (increasing the multiple) and what that increased compression would do to the image reconstruction. You might have the slider start at $\\frac{1}{5}$ at the low end, maybe $5$ at the high end, to provide a good range from very little quantization to a lot."
