    "Throughout this BlockTransform module we have thought about how the numbers we use to describe an image can be more or less efficient based on whether each number represents a single pixel or a whole pattern within a image block. This pattern-based composition of an image can very powerful due to the fact of *spatial coherence* in the images about which we are concerned.\n",

    "- The Standard/Euclidean basis patterns show how we conceptualize an image being displayed, where every coefficient/number represents information about an individual pixel, and all pixels are independent.\n",
    "- The Haar basis patterns showed how we can decompose the energy within a block by representing instead the average of the block plus many larger- and smaller-scale differences from that average.\n",

    "Each row of this matrix represents a sampled cosine wave with varying frequency over the signal space (s-D space, where s is the number of pixels). In that it satisfies the three conditions we specified above (left to you to prove), it can serve just as well as either of the above two. It is based in Fourier analysis on the idea that any signal can be constructed from [cosine and sine waveforms](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~vutha/405_teaching_materials/fourier_expansion_impedance.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The DCT is even more powerful for natural images because unlike the Standard and Haar bases, here every basis pattern extends over the whole block. In fact, [some form of DCT](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0036144598336745) is usually so powerful, it has been adopted for use in [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG), [MPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_Picture_Experts_Group), and many other image and video compression standards.\n",
