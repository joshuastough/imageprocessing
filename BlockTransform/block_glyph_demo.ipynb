    "We saw in spatial filtering that a mask of weights is placed over each pixel in the image, followed by computing the inner product (sum of products) of the corresponding mask weights and pixel values. This resulted in a filtered image that might show a blurred version of the original, or else horizontal or vertical edges, or edginess generally, or any of a number of local spatial characteristics. But the spatial neighborhood represented by the mask moves by one pixel each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, another way of viewing an image is as a grid of non-overlapping blocks, each block containing a number of pixels. A **block transform** is where we replace each block from the original image with a block of our choosing. We could choose to replace the whole collection of pixels in a block with the average or median color of the block. Or, as seen in this example, we can replace the block with a combination of the original block and a *glyph* image (basically, just a small image) that we'd like to overlay on our original."
