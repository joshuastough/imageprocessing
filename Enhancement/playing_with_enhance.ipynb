    "# Playing with Contrast Enhancement, Histogram Equalization\n",
    "stough 202-\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now seen how to improve image contrast through the application of transfer functions like [windowing, power/gamma, log, and others](./enhance_histeq.ipynb). We've also seen how [Histogram Equalization](./enhance_histeq.ipynb) creates an ideal transfer function in some sense--that of leading to a uniform histogram. Use these other demos in order to answer the following questions"
