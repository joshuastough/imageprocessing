Notwithstanding the photographer's intent in choreographing the shot, let's \"correct\" for my old eyes. A simple linear function might do.

    "You might notice a few additional artifacts in our corrected image above. For example the blue sky has turned a kind of aqua (maybe?). Additionally the colorful [lens flare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_flare) on the church and the blue tone of the leftmost rooftop are likely artifacts of the intense scaling done at the very low end of the input range, and not the most faithful representation of the underexposed foreground in reality. (Not that faithfulness to reality has to be the goal). Often in image acquisition, very small differences in R, G, and B are unreliable when found at the extreme low end. \n",

    "We would like to contrast-enhance the original underexposed image in a way that does not change hue too drastically (blue sky turning aqua). Conveniently then, in the [Color](../Color/color_intro.ipynb) module we saw several alternative colorspaces that separate the \"color\" from the brightness/value/luminance dimension of perception, and we can use any of these instead of RGB as above. \n",

If we $\\log$ transform the Luminance (L) only, leaving the chromaticity dimensions (a, b) constant, we might more objectively enhance the contrast in the underexposed foreground.  Do it!

Creating values outside of this range may lead to errors when converting back using [`color.lab2rgb`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.color.html#lab2rgb) \n",
