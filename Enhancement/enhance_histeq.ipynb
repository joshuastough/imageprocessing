    "At this point we've seen the usefulness of transfer functions for contrast enhancement in images, from simple linear windowing to nonliner transforms like power and log. We saw that in this context we look to construct transfer functions that dedicate more of the output range to the subset(s) of the input range where the image intensities are concentrated. In this notebook we'll practically formulate the ideal contrast enhancing transfer function given any particular image."

Be careful when you do though, as treating all channels as one distribution, as we've done here, can lead to the warping of color. This doesn't have much of an effect in our example since the R,G,B channels all do come from the same Gaussian distribution. In natural images that's less likely. To address this, think of [alternative colorspaces](../Color/color_intro.ipynb)."
