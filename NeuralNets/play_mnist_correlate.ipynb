Use [`norm`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html) and [`divide`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.divide.html) to pretty easily perform this normalization. \n",

However `divide` doesn't know what to do with $(10,3)$ and $(10,)$ for example, because the number of dimensions isn't even the same.
