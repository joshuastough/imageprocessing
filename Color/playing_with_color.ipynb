    "Take a look at `../dip_pics/world_overexposed.jpg`. Here we have a very overexposed image. (Again, find any overexposed image you like). What this means generally is that we have a lot of what should be color/Hue showing up as mostly white; as in, it's been mixed with too much white. See the [color_HSV](./color_HSV.ipynb) demo titled \"Viewing the planes of the HSV space\" and see what happens as saturation $S_{HSV}$ approaches zero. \n",

Then convert back to RGB and see if it's improved. **Remember**, from the [skimage documentation](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.color.html#skimage.color.rgb2hsv), that the hsv channels are all in $[0,1]$, so when you do the scaling you might need to `np.clip`.

    "## 3. Compression: Reducing the Bit-Depth of an Image to Save Space\n",
    "In a prior activity we reduced the bit-depth of the RGB color channels of an image and saw how that *quantization* affected the image quality, creating sharp edges of color change in what would be smoothly graded areas. So one of the limits of potentially compressing images relates to the minimum bit-depth that can maintain perceptual fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in this module's materials, we've seen that some color spaces (HSV, YCbCr, and L*a*b*) include some dimension that captures the brightness/luminance/intensity representation of an image separately from the \"color\" aspect. [YCbCr](./color_YCbCr.ipynb) in particular is used a lot in compression for precisely this reason.\n",

    "- See what happens when you reduce the bit-depth to 4-4-4 in RGB. \n",
    "- Then try reducing the bit-depth to 6-3-3 but **in the YCbCr** space. Here we're saving the same number of bits per pixel, but differentially quantizing (and therefore compressing) the **Luminance** and color components.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be useful here to define a function that quantizes a 2D `ndarray` instead of a whole image at once. Luckily, it's likely the same quantization function you've already written may suffice. I include a useable version here just to help.  \n",
