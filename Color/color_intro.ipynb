Humans (who can see) have [photoreceptor cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell), specialy-developed nerve cells called **rods** and **cones**. These cells are located in the retina, where light coming into the eye is focused. When you direct your vision somewhere, you are training the light toward your fovea, where the concentration of cones (4 to 7 million of them) is highest. The rods, on the periphery of vision, provide context and low-light vision. \n",
