    "In this notebook we're going to look at a way to account for very simple spatial redundancy, leading to much better compressibility. In short, a prediction of a pixel's value as its left neighbor is usually pretty effective, leading to a more compressible signal than the original without any loss of information. Read on for more.\n",

    "**Huffman**:\n",
    "In our discussion of [entropy](./entropy_intro.ipynb) we noted the different kinds of redundancy that we might leverage or account for in order to compress an image. We accounted for **coding redundancy** by applying Huffman variable length encoding. Huffman leverages differences in the relative probability of certain pixel values over others (low entropy) to define an encoding scheme that minimizes the average number of bits needed to represent each pixel value. Huffman's efficiency is inversely proportional to the entropy implied by the histogram of the image:\n",
    "- If the histogram tends toward uniform, entropy is high and Huffman coding will accomplish little.\n",
    "- If the histogram is highly non-uniform, with for example a few large spikes, then entropy is low and Huffman coding will work well.\n",
