***This book is still under construction. But the interactive visualizations work in binder without a time-consuming local install! Come check it out below!***

I am writing a book on introductory image processing in [Python](https://www.python.org/about/). For the sake of immediacy and usability, all content and code examples are in the form of IPython notebooks that execute through [binder](https://mybinder.org/)!
