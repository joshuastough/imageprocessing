    "# Sampling and Spatial Resolution\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the core properties of any digital image is its *resolution*. But this is a very loaded word in that it is used in a variety of ways for different purposes. Very generally, the light from the [external world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism) comes at our digital camera from a virtually uncountably infinite number of directions, with each direction specifying a \"color\" among a virtually uncountably infinite number of color distributions and intensities. Resolution broadly refers to the finite sampling of this infinite world. In the case of *spatial resolution* that is simply the number of *pixels* or \"picture elements\" that our camera can possibly obtain (see \"internal image plane\" below). Beyond spatial resolution, there is also [color resolution](./color_quantization.ipynb), which we get to elsewhere. \n",

    "As you can see the image matrix `I` is 2160 rows by 3840 columns, with three color channels (red, green, blue) in the integer range $[0,255]$. By the way this is literally a \"4K\" image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"4K\" refers to the approximate number of columns, or the left-right sampling of the image. At an aspect ratio of 16(width, columns):9(height, rows), a \"1080\" high definition image or screen is 1920 pixels across, about 2K. So a 4K is a 2x2 grid of such 2K screens. It has 4 times the number of pixels in a 2K (or 1080). It's more [complicated](https://www.cnet.com/news/4k-1080p-2k-uhd-8k-tv-resolutions-explained/) than that, but not by much.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think of an image as a grid of pixels, where the center of each pixel represents that pixel's coordinates, then changing the resolution of an image involves resampling the space between those pixel coordinates. We'll avoid most of the math here by relying on `skimage`, but take a very simple example: If we wanted to halve the number of pixels both in width and height without cropping, we could just take the average of every 2x2 pixels. Similarly, if we wanted to double the number of pixels in both directions, we could simply make a 2x2 grid of copies of each pixel. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by doing this halving of resolution. We'll first ask [`rescale`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.transform.html?highlight=rescale#rescale) to give us an image 1/4 the number of pixels. But then we'll *upsample* that image by four. The `order` and `anti-aliasing` parameters are used to define the level of \"smoothing\" that takes place, i.e. how many neighboring pixels to consider when deciding the color of the new sample coordinate."
