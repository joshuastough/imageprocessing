    "[Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) is a powerful toolkit for the handling of large N-dimensional arrays or matrices, conveniently wrapped in Python. Given the relative inefficiencies of handling large lists of numbers in native Python, Numpy [`ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html)s have become the backbone of scientific computation in Python. In this notebook we'll first show some time comparisons between `ndarray` and Python list basic functions, then explore some of the very useful Numpy methods. \n",

    "This is a highly stripped-down introduction. The intent is to learn much of what we need along the way, as we find uses for some of Numpy's functionality. However, See Numpy's own [quickstart tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html) for a more complete introduction.\n",

    "We know Python lists as a really easy-to-use dynamic list implementation that includes powerful object-oriented and functional interactions, where elements of a list can be of any type. This flexibility of the list type is accomplished through the use of pointers in a way that is hidden from the programmer--under the hood--but that negatively impacts performance. Numpy on the other hand constrains all elements of an `ndarray` to be of the same type; under the hood, numpy arrays can be stored in contiguous memory with constant access time. \n",
