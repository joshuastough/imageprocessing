    "[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a powerful toolkit for the handling of large N-dimensional arrays or matrices, conveniently wrapped in Python. Given the relative inefficiencies of handling large lists of numbers in native Python, Numpy [`ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html)s have become the backbone of scientific computation in Python. In this notebook we'll first show some time comparisons between `ndarray` and Python list basic functions, then explore a some of the very useful Numpy methods. \n",

    "This is a highly stripped-down introduction. The intent is that much of what we need along the way, as we find uses for some of Numpy's functionality. See Numpy's own [quickstart tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html) for a more complete introduction.\n",

    "We know Python lists as a really easy-to-use dynamic list implementation that includes powerful object-oriented and functional interactions, where elements of a list can be of any type. This flexibility of the list type is accomplished through the use of pointers in a way that is hidden from the programmer--under the hood. Numpy on the other hand constrains all elements of an `ndarray` to be of the same type; under the hood, numpy arrays can be stored in contiguous memory with constant access time. \n",

    "One significant note here is that there is a big precision reduction: the *integer* primitive in Python is for arbitrary magnitude integral values and requires 28 bytes, while the implicitly determined `np.int64` requires only 8 bytes with a more limited magnitude range. In conjunction with the direct packing (instead of pointer packing) in memory, the `ndarray` variable `np_lyst` requires much less memory than the Python variable `lyst`, and likely engenders much better cache coherence (read: average memory access time). Read more about it [here](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1249560/pages/python-lists-vs-numpy-arrays-what-is-the-difference) or [here](https://medium.com/@gough.cory/performance-of-numpy-array-vs-python-list-194c8e283b65).

    "The final timing examples above show the efficiency of Python list comprehensions and the equivalent numpy expression. The above list comprehensions (or `list(map(...`) create a new list object where every element of the original list has been scaled by a constant. Such Pythonic expressions execute in interpreted bytecode, which can be quite a bit slower than comparative compiled C. Using smart [operator overloading](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names), the creators of Numpy encoded equivalent functionality that executes almost entirely in C, resulting in significant speedup (e.g., ~70x on list size 10K in my observations). We can actually observe this efficiency indirectly just in the amount of bytecode involved in the competing approaches, using Python's [disassembler module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html)."
